For an instance, model predictive control, nonlinear model predictive control, sliding mode control etc

Now you can see the examples of control theories as following

- **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with CGMRES**
- **Linear Model Predictive Control**(as generic function such as matlab tool box)
- **Extended Lineat Model Predictive Control for vehicle model**
